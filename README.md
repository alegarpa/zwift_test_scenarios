A demonstration of my understanding of how a POM would look like in Java.

Enjoy!

1.  Follow along with the instructions linked below on setting up your environment:
	https://www.guru99.com/installing-selenium-webdriver.html
	
	Stopping at Step 4

2.Download Google Chrome:

Note The webdriver in this repo supports: **Version 91.0.4472.101**

3. Access the Java Build Path: Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path

4. Go to Class Path -> Add external jars and add the jars unzipped from:  
	selenium-3.141.59.zip(Version may vary from zipped one). 

5. Go to Class Path -> Add Library -> Junit -> Junit5 -> Finish
6. Select Apply and Close

## Execution 

 
If using eclipse go to **src/pages/zwift_test_scenarios** and use run.

**I'll apologize I didn't spend enough time here pursing running using a command line but the information is below.**
